      "text": "Our journey to the Nazca Lines began in Lima, and it was an experience that exceeded all expectations. From the moment we were picked up the night before  by our driver, Juan, at our hotel, everything was perfectly organized.After a comfortable drive from Lima to Nasca (6 hours) we were taken on a scenic journey through the desert landscape, with Carlos providing insights along the way. We arrived at the first stop—the Nazca miradores (viewpoints). Here, we were able to take in our first glimpses of the massive geoglyphs. It’s truly amazing to stand on the ground and see the figures stretch across the desert. Carlos explained the history and the mystery behind the lines, which made it all the more captivating.Next, we headed to the local airport for our overflight. The airport process was smooth, and we were assisted at every step by the team, which made us feel completely at ease. Our guide remained with us, ensuring we had everything we needed for the flight.Once aboard the 6-passenger plane, we took to the skies, and the views of the Nazca Lines were absolutely breathtaking. The flight offered a bird’s-eye view of the iconic figures such as the Monkey, the Spider, and the Hummingbird. As we soared over the desert, our pilot expertly maneuvered the plane, ensuring we had the best angles and clear views of each geoglyph. The experience was surreal, and it felt almost impossible to believe we were flying above something so ancient and mysterious. The pilot also provided useful commentary, pointing out the figures and sharing additional historical context, making the flight even more informative.The whole experience, from the informative mirador visits to the thrilling overflight, was well-paced and perfectly managed by Get2Peru.com. They made sure we were comfortable, informed, and able to make the most of this unique experience.This was, without a doubt, one of the most memorable parts of our trip to Peru. From pick-up in Lima to the final moments of our flight, the team’s professionalism and passion for the Nazca Lines made it a truly unforgettable adventure. If you’re in Lima and have the chance to explore the Nazca Lines, I highly recommend booking this tour. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should not be missed!",

      "text": "If you have a day to get to know the lines, this experience is highly recommended! They pick you up from your hotel in Miraflores the night before, we travel in a super comfortable bus, reclining seats at 160°, bathrooms and air conditioning, you have a screen to watch movies, listen to music or read a book, the night trip doesn't even feel like it, you arrive very early and our guide Juan was waiting for us, they bought us a coffee and prepared us for the overflight with interesting information about the Lines and tips to make the most of it and not miss any figure, they gave us a map where the figures that we are going to see are marked and they offered us options Of the tour we could do, we chose to visit the viewpoints since they show figures that are not in the 35-minute flight. These are called Palpa figures and they are older than those of Nazca. We visited 5 viewpoints. Our guide was great, a lot of valuable information and an excellent prepare for the flight. We arrived at the airport around 9 am and they were already waiting for us with everything organized. They weighed us on a scale and we proceeded to board the flight. It is incredible what you see from above. It leaves you amazed. The lines have no definition, but they are unique and mysterious thanks to the advice from Juan Carlos we had a great time! At the end of the flight we decided on another tour to visit the mothers of Chauchilla and at the end we returned to the get2peru offices, which also have their family restaurant next door. We ate, we relaxed using the free Wi-Fi and with a few minutes remaining we crossed the runway to the station to board. Our bus at 2 in the afternoon returned to Lima. We would have liked to know that from Nasca we could take a bus to Arequipa, but still everything was excellent and thank you, Get2peru team! 100% highly recommended",

      "text": "This is a great way to see the fantastic sights. Admittedly a long,  full day when travel is included. However the coaches are really comfortable, with seats which recline and, leg rests. We were looked after really well, with great communication before hand and, attentive care during the trip. We were picked up at our hotel ( by Juan) and transported to the bus station. Our driver stayed to ensure we boarded the right bus. We were greeted at the end of the journey by Juan Carlos who made us welcome. We had a detailed briefing of what we would see and told to ensure we got the most out of our flight. We took an additional, optional tour, to see sights from the ground, before embarking on flight, Juan was again very attentive, making sure the processes ran smoothly.Our journey / for information. 21:30 pick up. 22:15 bus. Arrival in Nazca - 05:25. We are catching 14:00 back to Lima and expect to be there about 21:30, Long , but gear day. Thanks all to all those involved in helping it be so good!",
