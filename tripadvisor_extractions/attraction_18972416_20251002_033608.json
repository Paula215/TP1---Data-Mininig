This tour was a perfect match for our needs.  We were picked up at our hotel by Daniel and driven to our first stop, Cevicheria Terminal Pesquero where we enjoyed a squid ceviche with corn fritters (tortitas de choclo)..absolutely delicious!  Next, we walked to Sofá Café where we had creamy tacu tacu (peruvian rice and bean cake) topped with sautéed shrimp.  From there we walked through beautiful streets, to a local art museum featuring the works of graffiti artist Jade Rivera. The docent was a lovely young woman whose name I forget.   We loved her commentary, and her delightful manner.  After that, we went to Dédalo Art Gallery and Café, an art collective where you could browse works for sale and also enjoy the next item on our food journey – pastel de choclo (sweet corn pie).  Our next stop was the Bridge of Sighs, where we held our breath as we crossed it and made a wish. Hope it comes true!  At the other end was Tio Mario where we had anticucuhos (grilled beef hearts!) with various sauces.  By this time, we were stuffed, but somehow found room in our tummies for dessert-freshly made picarones (Peruvian doughnuts) with syrup.  These were delicious! We were picked up by our driver and escorted back to the hotel by Daniel.  Along the way, we had wonderful conversation with Daniel, who was very knowledgeable and considerate.

      "text": "We booked this tour one day in advance and were happy Daniel had time to accommodate us. We were the only two on the tour, which was in the Barranco neighborhood. To be transparent about what the tour consisted of, it didn’t include street graffiti or 20 tastings. That being said, we thoroughly enjoyed our tour with Daniel. He took us to 5 restaurants where we could sit down at tables and enjoy great local food. After the second restaurant, we went through the Jade Rivera museum where we were given an overview of the artist’s work by a museum employee. The third restaurant was in an art collective where we had time to browse local artisans’ work for sale. A small section of the collective sold alcohol and with Daniel’s assistance, we were able to taste and buy two bottles of Pisco to bring home! The last restaurant was at a lovely dessert restaurant owned by a local pastry chef. All the food we tasted was EXCELLENT and we thoroughly enjoyed it all because in all our time in Lima and Cusco, we had only had one of the foods on this tour, which was ceviche. So everything was new to us and very different than the other foods we’d had during our trip. We considered everything “local comfort food” and we’d go back to any of these restaurants again by ourselves. To comment on Daniel- he makes the whole experience very fun. He is completely disarming and and extremely knowledgeable about Peru and many other countries as he has traveled internationally. He converses easily and shows wonderful  interest in his clients. He paced the restaurants nicely and the walking was all on level ground in beautiful Barranco. There were restrooms at every restaurant and Daniel was very thoughtful about asking us if we needed to use them at each stop. We hadn’t seen this neighborhood so we were happy to take it in. It’s very clean and pretty with beautiful buildings, lots of greenery, and flowers. The restaurants were uniquely decorated and fun to see. Definitely a low key, fun way to see Barranco and eat some great food!",

The tour guide and all staff are so kind, so accommodating, and so thoughtful about every single stop. You never feel rushed. It happened to be my birthday and they really went above and beyond and out of their way. My God Daniel was the absolute best. We had wonderful conversation, he explained everything, at each stop there was delicious food, or art or history to learn. From the Tacu Tacu to the Jade Rivera Gallery to the Beverages to the street art and historical sites I could not have asked for more. Please do not hesitate to book this tour. I really can’t say enough. He took tons of amazing photos so that I could concentrate on soaking up all the information and he obviously had good relationships with every location. We stopped at. I mean, he even went out of his way to help me find elevation sickness, pills for my next day trip to Machu Picchu. It was one of the best way I’ve ever had and I’ve been using Viator for years in countries, all around the world. The food portions were so plentiful. It was not just a tour. It was an experience, and I felt like I was being treated so wonderfully every step of the way.",
