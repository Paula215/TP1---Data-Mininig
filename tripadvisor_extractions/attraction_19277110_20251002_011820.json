We booked through ticketmaster as we found this easier. The drinks were really well priced, and we had eaten before we came so didn’t have anything to eat. Everything is in Spanish so as a unilingual English speaker, sometimes you had to guess what was going on. This was different than similar shows I’ve been to in other countries in that it was interactive with the audience. There would be one or two cultural dances and then the MC would chat to the audience a bit, then the audience would be invited up on stage to dance for a song or two. The audience seemed to really enjoy this. It was fun to watch people dance, but I would honestly rather the show be 2 hours of the professionals dancing than 4 hours of the mix of pros and audience as it was a long time to stay there. They quality of the costumes and dancers was great &amp; the service was attentive. We never felt pressured to order or buy anything, although we did have a few drinks that were delicious.</div><div class=\"WCuqd\"><button class=\"UikNM _G B- _S _W u _T c G_ wSSLS wnNQG\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"biGQs _P ezezH\"><div class=\"ifjNr _S n Ci\">Read more</div></span></button></div></div></div><div class=\"biGQs _P VImYz navcl\"><div class=\"Me\">Written <!-- -->April 23, 2024</div></div></div><div data-carousel-waypoint=\"true\"></div></li><li class=\"bfUbN hsTfP Fg I _u\"><div class=\"hYnnA z B1 Z BB MGMVT\"><div class=\"f u MJ\"><div class=\"\"><div class=\"bmHys hzzSG ccudK Rb I o\"><div class=\"\"><svg width=\"48\" height=\"48\" aria-label=\"H3752WEtiffanyl\" viewBox=\"0 0 120 120\"><rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" class=\"DdFLM\"></rect><circle cx=\"59.101\" cy=\"53.731\" r=\"26.866\" class=\"cDXFZ\"></circle><circle cx=\"58.408\" cy=\"131.846\" r=\"51.25\" class=\"mjFhG\"></circle></svg></div></div></div><div><div class=\"biGQs _P VImYz ZNjnF\">H3752WEtiffanyl</div><div class=\"biGQs _P VImYz xARtZ navcl\"></div><div class=\"biGQs _P VImYz xARtZ navcl\"><span><span class=\"\">0</span> contributions</span></div></div></div><div class=\"kyhmT\"><div class=\"VVbkp\"><div class=\"MyMKp u\"><div class=\"nKWJn u\"><svg class=\"evwcZ\" viewBox=\"0 0 128 24\" width=\"68\" height=\"12\" aria-labelledby=\":lithium-Rid6tpbufklauinjlq:\" data-automation=\"bubbleRatingImage\"><title id=\":lithium-Rid6tpbufklauinjlq:\">5 of 5 bubbles</title><path d=\"M 12 0C5.388 0 0 5.388 0 12s5.388 12 12 12 12-5.38 12-12c0-6.612-5.38-12-12-12z\" transform=\"\"></path><path d=\"M 12 0C5.388 0 0 5.388 0 12s5.388 12 12 12 12-5.38 12-12c0-6.612-5.38-12-12-12z\" transform=\"translate(26 0)\"></path><path d=\"M 12 0C5.388 0 0 5.388 0 12s5.388 12 12 12 12-5.38 12-12c0-6.612-5.38-12-12-12z\" transform=\"translate(52 0)\"></path><path d=\"M 12 0C5.388 0 0 5.388 0 12s5.388 12 12 12 12-5.38 12-12c0-6.612-5.38-12-12-12z\" transform=\"translate(78 0)\"></path><path d=\"M 12 0C5.388 0 0 5.388 0 12s5.388 12 12 12 12-5.38 12-12c0-6.612-5.38-12-12-12z\" transform=\"translate(104 0)\"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><div class=\"biGQs _P SewaP alXOW EEXWj GzNcM BYtua UTQMg alvrA ncFvv W ezezH\">Cool experience!</div><div class=\"biGQs _P VImYz AWdfh\"><div class=\"_T FKffI bmUTE\"><div class=\"fIrGe _T bgMZj\" style=\"-webkit-line-clamp:3;line-break:normal;cursor:auto\">Very interactive dance show - be ready to perform!

We didn't notice the shortage until we were on our way back to our hotel. We don't know if it was the waiter or the person at the register that ripped us off. Beware if you attend and double check that you receive the correct change. I would have rated the event much higher but could not do so knowing they have employees who took advantage.
