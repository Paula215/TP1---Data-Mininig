      "text": "It was super easy to organize the voucher through TripAdvisor. They provide bicycles specifically dedicated to your size. I was staying in Miraflores and took a bus for 2 Sol to grab the bike. Diego spoke perfect English and, gave me a map and explained everything. In Mira Flores you are basically on dedicated bicycle lines so it is quite safe. Helmet and lock supplied Surprisingly the drivers respect the bicycle lanes and are careful. You could ride all the way into downtown but I'm not sure that's the greatest of ideas. I visited the ancient ruins site of Huaca Pucilano then headed for the coast and Ride Along the bicycle lane to the Morro Solar. I must admit you probably need Google Maps to work out exactly where you are at times. I had a great day hire from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. what a bargain. I highly recommend it.",

They do not have lockers at the bike rental office but there is a corner where you can store backpacks, etc. since someone is always there. I would recommend doing this if you are in the area.",
