      "text": "The site should not be visited from Lima when the Rio near Caral is flooding. Our car trip from Lima, in a small vehicle with ordinary suspension, took 14 hours. Of these 14 hours, about 10 were spent on the road, and of these 10 hours 3 were spent on a tedious and unkempt dirt road that now serves chicken farms. We were the only tourist party on the road. These three hours were not only tedious but they were excruciating because my wife suffers from severe back pain and the bumpy drive triggered an inflammatory crisis. She will have to spend time in bed to recover. The company, Inca Trilogy Tour, told us that the new road currently used to access Caral could not be taken because of the Rio's flooding. We would have liked to have been told of the fact when we booked the tour. POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, BE SURE TO CHECK THE ITINERARY OF THIS TOUR BEFORE BOOKING a Caral tour with it. We suggest that the tour not be offered when the Rio is flooding.",
