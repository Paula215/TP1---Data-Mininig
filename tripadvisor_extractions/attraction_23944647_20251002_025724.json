Everything was very well organized from start to finish.Our driver Henry was safe, professional, and made the long journey comfortable. Our guide Jaime was knowledgeable, friendly, and always made sure we were having a good time. He explained everything clearly and added a personal touch to the experience.The tour itself was an amazing combination of sights — from the boat ride in Paracas with its stunning views and wildlife, to the unforgettable adventure in the Huacachina desert oasis.We highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Lima who wants to explore more of Peru in just one day.

We had a fantastic time exploring the sand dunes in a buggy, which was a thrilling way to see the landscape. The wine tasting was a delightful surprise, offering a unique and relaxed break in our adventure. The marine boat tour was equally amazing, giving us a beautiful perspective from the water.A huge part of what made this tour so special was our driver, Henry, and our guide, Jaime. Henry was an exceptionally safe and skilled driver, making us feel completely at ease on the roads. Jaime was the perfect tour guide—knowledgeable, fun, and attentive to every detail. They both went above and beyond to make sure we had the best day possible.I highly recommend this private tour to anyone looking for a unique and action-packed day. Thank you, Henry and Jaime, for a truly memorable experience!",

So, with that in mind, one of the best day trips I’ve been on EVER! Jaime, our guide and Henry, our driver, took such excellent care of us. Our tiny group of 3 didn’t wait any lines, everything was organized so smoothly and come hungry!!! There was so much great food and the alcohol was great too!  I saw penguins, sea lions, got splashed by Pacific Ocean water (maybe bring a rain jacket or sit in middle of the boat), got to learn about Peruvian wine and pisco making,  more important, tasted them. Then it was off to the oasis where the dune buggy and the sand boarding awaits! This dune buggy is legit for those adrenaline junkies, we flew a bit and the sand boarding was so fun!!!!! Please please pleas book this, you won’t regret it!",

Jaime provided much history of the region and willingly explained and answered every question with a deep knowledge and insight.Patrick’s adept driving quickly and expertly got us in and out of Lima without any doubt whatsoever. Patrick also managed the tricky traffic of the region without any issues.The sand buggy and sand surfing were an absolute thrill! Jaime was a lifesaver when we arrived at the restaurant. Jaime took the time and effort to ensure our breakfast order was ready, and the food was delicious and hot. Lunch was just as well prepared and thoughtful. And the time we spent at the Tamara winery was a perfect way to wrap up a great adventure. I highly recommend Jaime and Patrick to escort us on another adventure in the future!",
