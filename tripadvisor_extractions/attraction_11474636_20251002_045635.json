Initially Kevin taking the booking and dealing with our queries, Firorella reaching out before we departed, meeting us with tickets and keeping us updated to the minute when our train was delayed due to a landslide at Machu Picchu.Hotels chosen were in great locations, all pick ups and drop offs were on time and reliable.Our guide around MP, Javier, was fantastic.Overall we had an enjoyable and stress free introductory  first (of hopefully more) visit to Peru.",

During the trip, the guides were very professional and friendly and very knowledgeable as well. Fiorella managed our operations and was available the many times we needed. Natalie was our guide in Cusco and she was really amazing. My kids loved the way she narrated and taught us all about the interesting facts about Cusco. She was in tune with our needs as well as we had missing baggage and needed clothes and shoes. She also understood the various needs of the family and accommodated so tirelessly. The altitude sickness was hitting some of us and she helped with some oil and made the tour bearable as well. Her energy was amazing.Machu Picchu was a marvellous experience and PS planned it very well for us. Immaculate timing and weather. We loved it. The tour back in Lima was very relaxing and beautiful. The Barranco neighbourhood was our favourite. The hotels curated were great. We had to cancel a mountain trip in Cusco and we had requested for spa alternatives and PS accommodated all very well. Thank you!!!",
