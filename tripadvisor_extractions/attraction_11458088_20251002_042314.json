See the diverse range of creatures that live in the coastal areas of Peru, including Peruvian pelicans, Andean coots, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and more. Exploring the area with a guide takes the guesswork out of spotting wildlife, as you’ll be taken to areas where different species have been spotted before.",

      "text": "Absolutely fantastic experience. The guides were brilliant. We were accompanied by Manuel, who was passionate and knowledgeable, despite having only been there for a short time. Saw around thirty birds which were new for me in a few short hours, including some incredibly close. Highlights included vermilion flycatchers, many coloured rush tyrants (who are apparently sometimes difficult to spot, but were incredibly obliging for us), Wilson's phalarope, Harris hawks, and many more. Also heard, but not seen, was the very shy least bittern.I'd like to thank again our fantastic guides, who offered not only knowledge of the local wildlife, including insects, spiders and snakes, as well as birds, but also insight on the people and area (in multiple languages as well)  Great value for money and a wonderful birdwatching experience. Highly recommended.",

She was highly knowldgable and knew where to find my target birds including the Many-colored Rush Tyrant, Peruvian Meadowlark and the Plumbeous Rail. There was also a very nice driver so Nicole and I could focus on the birds.  I was picked up promptly at my hotel and delivered back to the hotel.",

      "text": "Jorge was a great guide. Kind and well-educated. Very knowledgeable about birds. Could ID by audio on most occasions.Added 19 new species to my life list today! About 58 in total for the day, wonderful!Jorge was also very engaged with the public, who may or may not be as invested in protecting the natural area. But you can see how his passion enables him to inform people and enlist them into the values of conservation.The boat tour as well was a special way to experience the humedal (brackish swamp). It would not have been possible to enter this park during birding hours without his bona fide guide credentials.Some favorites: the many-colored rush tyrant, Peruvian pipit, Peruvian meadowlark, burrowing owls, Peruvian thick-knee, Chilean Flamingo, and Great Grebe!",

The extra cost of the boat trip was absolutely worth it. I saw my first baby coot in the wild! The location is really neat, with varied habitats and many different kinds of birds. Totally worth the time and money! Thank you so much Nicole!",

With 1000s of birds bring closed, old shoes as you will come back with evidence of 1000s of birds.  Only port a potty available in each location.  Trip was less than 4 hours including transportation to & from Isidro hotel but could have been longer if we took more photos or had others with us—it was just my husband & I.",
