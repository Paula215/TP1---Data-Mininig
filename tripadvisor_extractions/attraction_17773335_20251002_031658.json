Our tour was in a comfortable mini van with a great tour guide.  JJ was knowledgeable about his city and our driver was able to get us quickly through the crazy traffic in the city.<br>We had dinner at a very nice Peruvian restaurant (very generous portions) then went to the Magic Water show.  Our driver dropped us off right at the entrance and JJ got us into the park quickly, bypassing the long queue.<br>Having a great guide and tour is a must for first time visitor to Lima.  Unless you really know the area well, don't wander around on your own.<br>We are very happy with this tour.</span></span></div></div><div class=\"lszDU\" style=\"line-height: 24px;\"><button class=\"UikNM _G B- _S _W u _T c G_ wSSLS wnNQG\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"biGQs _P ezezH\">Read more</span><div class=\"CECjK _W\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" class=\"d Vb UmNoP\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M18.4 7.4 12 13.7 5.6 7.4 4.2 8.8l7.8 7.8 7.8-7.8z\"></path></svg></div></button></div></div><div></div><div class=\"TreSq\"><div class=\"biGQs _P VImYz ncFvv navcl\">Written December 14, 2024</div><div class=\"biGQs _P VImYz mowmC navcl\"><span>This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

      "text": "Our ship changed the shuttle drop off location in the city but Haku tour was able to meet us at the new location.  Our tour was in a comfortable mini van with a great tour guide.  JJ was knowledgeable about his city and our driver was able to get us quickly through the crazy traffic in the city.We had dinner at a very nice Peruvian restaurant (very generous portions) then went to the Magic Water show.  Our driver dropped us off right at the entrance and JJ got us into the park quickly, bypassing the long queue.Having a great guide and tour is a must for first time visitor to Lima.  Unless you really know the area well, don't wander around on your own.We are very happy with this tour.",

We had a rough start just getting off our cruise ship and thru the port - I let Haku know of the delay, and they responded and waited for all of us with no issue. We then had the amazing Cesar as our guide and we couldn’t have been happier! He was friendly, knowledgeable, funny and helpful - and really set a great tone for the tour. Loved the sights (and those churros were delish!!), the catacombs, and dinner was yummy as well (Pisco sour and lomo saltado - yum!). After the hassle at the port we decided very last minute to spend the night in Miraflores (lovely area), and Cesar afjusted and helped to make sure we got an Uben easily from our last stop. One of the highlights of our trip - thank you Cesar and Haku!",
