      "text": "I had the absolute pleasure of joining Susan’s Miraflores, Barranco & San Isidro tour, and it was one of the highlights of my trip to Lima. From the moment we met, Susan’s warmth and professionalism stood out. She has an incredible way of blending history, culture, and local stories that brought each district to life in a way no guidebook ever could.In Miraflores, she gave us fascinating insights into the coastal views and modern vibe of the district, making sure we didn’t just see the landmarks but truly understood their place in Lima’s identity. Barranco was a treat — Susan’s storytelling turned its colorful streets, street art, and bohemian charm into a living canvas. By the time we explored San Isidro, she had seamlessly shifted gears to highlight its elegance, green spaces, and historical importance.What impressed me most was how Susan tailored the experience to our interests, making the tour feel personal and engaging. She was attentive, answered every question with patience and depth, and made sure we experienced both the must-see highlights and hidden gems.Her passion for Lima is contagious, and her knowledge is remarkable. I walked away not only with great photos but also with a real connection to the city and its culture.I can’t recommend Susan’s tour highly enough — whether it’s your first time in Lima or you’ve visited before, she will show you the city in a way you’ll never forget.",

They take you to San Isidro which is a beautiful city in Lima and not many tour. The tour guide was great. He spoke perfect English.",
