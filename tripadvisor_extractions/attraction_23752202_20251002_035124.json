    "ItineraryThis is a typical itinerary for this productStop At:Nasca Lines, Nazca PeruAfter picking you up, we will go to Paracas city to flight around the famous and enigmatic Nazca Lines. They are a group of very large geoglyphs hand formed/scratched out to make very strong depressions or shallow dirt removals in the dark soil of the Nazca Desert to reveal the very white under layer of rock or clay. These were carved out sometime between 200 AD and possibly 600 AD. There is no written record of the exact dates, but these seem to be a possible time frame. There is no a definitive reason for the carvings; however, numerous theories have been advanced: sculptures to be seen from the surrounding mountains, a big work project to worship they ancestors, or possibly a kind of message for their god so as to have water since the area is dry and it almost does not rain. You will watch the most representative figures such as the hummingbird, spider, monkey, geometrical forms and other mysterious forms.Duration: 2 hoursStop At:Pisco Nietto, Bodega Fundo Tres Esquinas, s/n, Ica PeruTasting of wines and piscos + Lunch\nThis is one of the oldest vineyard of this region which produce different types of pisco and wine where we are going to have the opportunity of having a special pisco and wine tastingDuration: 3 hoursStop At:Huacachina, Huacachina, Ica RegionAfter, we will go to Huacachina to see its beautiful oasis which is the perfect destination for those travelers looking to relax surrounded by nature and beautiful landscapes.

He was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and genuinely invested in making sure we had the best possible experience. On top of that, he spoke perfect English, which made everything smooth.We were even able to customize the tour to our interests — instead of visiting Pisco Nietto, we opted for the Paracas National Reserve, which was absolutely worth it. The Huacachina oasis and the dunes in the desert were so much fun. And, of course, the Nazca Lines were AMAZING, a true once-in-a-lifetime sight! This tour was especially convenient because the flight departs from Ica airport, allowing us to skip an unnecessarily extra-long car drive.Thank you so much Felipe!",

The journey is long, but the car was very comfortable and passed up that fast. Although not the biggest attraction of the tour, the Oasis is quite cool and the sandboard and buggy ride are fun. We have lunch at the vineyard and we continue to the flight over the lines of Nasca which are charming.  We loved the walk. Special thanks to Guia Ronald and driver Carlos.",

The team that provided the tour, Felipe, and our driver were exceptional. We were picked up on time and taken from our hotel to the Pisco airport, a several-hour drive in a comfortable SUV. Our driver ensured a very smooth and safe drive. During the drive, Felipe provided helpful background information on the Nazca lines. He is very knowledgeable and can communicate complex concepts in a friendly and understandable manner.When we arrived at the airport, he took us to the museum and continued explaining what we would see while we waited to receive our seat assignments on the plane.The Nazca Lines plane flight was a once-in-a-lifetime experience! Upon our return, we drove to the Huacachina Oasis. The dune buggy company and driver provided exceptional service, making our dune buggy ride thrilling and memorable. We ate a delicious lunch. We also did a private tasting at the beautiful Tabernero winery, and Felipe ensured we tasted high-end sipping piscos. We had an excellent drive back to our hotel.We highly recommend the tour. It’s more expensive than others because you spend less time (hours) on the road, and the plane flight is more expensive since it’s from a closer airport to Lima. However, it was well worth it! It is a first-class tour.",
