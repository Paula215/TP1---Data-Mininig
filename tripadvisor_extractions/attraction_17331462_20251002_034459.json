I have been trying to get ahold of them for a week to either reschedule for when they are open or get a refund.  I have left both voicemails and emails and no one has responded to me. 0/10 recommend",

      "text": "The Peruvian experience was amazing and worth the money. The guides are able to present in bother English and Spanish. If you are traveling alone, having a group experience is nice. I never felt like I wasn't a part of the group, during the tour, and it was super fun to get to know new people. Pro tip: the chocolate museum (el museo de chocó) near parque Kennedy has 25% off coupons for the experience. Also, if you're a foreigner, do not forget your passport or a picture of your passport to participate in the experience. Enjoy!",

We did the full guided tour, which covers some cultural background information similar to a museum, a series of short movies, a Pisco Sour cocktail workshop, a \"make your own ceviche\" cooking workshop and then a tasting of the most representative dishes of Peru.We really had a great time and the two hours went by very fast.  The staff was incredibly friendly and joyful.  The food was amazing, and I certainly recommend not eating prior to this tour, as you will be getting a very full meal.I recommend this tour to anybody visiting Lima.  The price is excellent in comparison to what you receive and you will have a great time.",
