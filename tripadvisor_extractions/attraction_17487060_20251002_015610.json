He is able to break down complex moves into simpler ones for his students. He also offered to show me around around Lima, and showed me some places that only locals would know! In addition, he took me to Barranco, pachacamac, al circuito del agua, Lima downtown, the beach, surquillo mercado and many more places !! He also made great recommendations and took me to the best places to try authentic Peruvian food. Luis went above and beyond the salsa class to make my experience in Lima an incredible and unforgettable one.",

He has group classes and will also do privates, he even came to our apartment building to teach us up 2-3 times a week! Hes a former pro salsa dancer and he is incredibly talented, professional, super patient, and even helped us practice our Spanish and meet locals while we were here. I have ALWAYS wanted to learn how to be a good dancer, and this year I made it my official New Years Resolution to actually try! I have no rhythm, cant count music, and am taller than most men I've ever danced with so.... it seemed like a pretty hopeless resolution, but I'm now this much closer to not looking like a crazy person on the dance floor, thanks to Luis. Our month in Lima wouldn't have been the same without him, he truly made it a million times better and we had so much fun with him!!!",
