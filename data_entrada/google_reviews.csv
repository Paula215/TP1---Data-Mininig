I opted for a cappuccino and avocado toast, and shared the hummus with a friend since it was supposed to be really good. Sadly, there was very little flavor to any of the food and I had to reach for the salt grinder, which I never do.

There’s another spot just down the road that serves one of the best tostada con plata dishes I’ve had in Lima. Next time, we will head there instead since the conversation was the best part of this outing.",7 months ago

167,45,Alfred Moon,3,"The atmosphere is peaceful. It has welcoming facilities and the place is well maintained. The church is medium-sized and looks tidy. Everything is fine: the atmosphere, the well-maintained infrastructure, the priest's homily in simple and understandable language, the prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph at the end of Mass, etc.

What really caught my attention was the church choir: it is very festive, using various musical instruments, including the charango, bass drum, shaker, tambourine, guitar, etc. The choirs (with various singers) also draw attention with their harmonies and some changes in the rhythms and cadences of the songs, making them even more joyful compared to those I've heard in other churches.

For a moment, I thought I was at a celebration in a Protestant church.

I am also surprised that at the time of the Eucharist, they begin to play songs with very cheerful melodies when receiving Jesus is a solemn and reflective moment. There is joy in receiving Christ, of course, but after receiving the body of Jesus, the person goes to their seat and says a prayer and communicates with Jesus God, praying and giving thanks for the gift received... but I feel that the songs are too distracting. In other parishes, they play ""Fisher of Men"" and similar songs, which seem more appropriate to me.

It would be nice to return to the times of solemnity and respect for the sacrifice that is the Mass, because as we know, in the Mass the sacrifice of the cross is made present and is an offering to God. We should be aware of this fact and avoid distractions. Regarding musical instruments, Pope Pius X recommended the use of the organ, but there are many recommendations that are no longer heeded, giving way to modern customs. As I heard recently: the Church should not adapt (modernize) to the times, but rather the opposite.",a month ago

I also 100% recommend Father Victor's Mass on Sundays at 6 pm, as it has a very unique style, with a touch of humor while still being spiritually uplifting.
Community life is also encouraged, and parishioners are always invited to join the various parish groups.

246,62,H Arana,1,"Back in mid 2021 I went to a Sunday service just for a short visit and to listen to the sermon. Before the service even started this random American man who had his wife and children wrapped around his arms, left his pew and approached mine which was behind him. He opened with: ""Do you speak English?"" which is a pretty stupid and discriminatory question to ask someone  you just met. He proceded to interrogate me and inquire about my nationality and if it was my first time visiting the church. He was invading my personal space and didn't even tell me his name. That was pretty inappropriate behavior from a regular from the church. I'd heard about discrimination against Peruvians at this place, but it'd never happened to me before. I'd been there countlesd times already even though I was not a regular anymore. I am a white Peruvian young man, but unlike some of these people I don't discriminate others on looks. Even since pastor Angus left, everything went downhill at this place.
I read some of the comments being: ""If you're an English native speaker, this is the right place for you?"" What about Peruvian born people?

The waves are consistent and attract both beginners and experienced surfers, with surf schools and board rentals available right by the shore. The beach itself is rocky rather than sandy, so it’s not the best spot for sunbathing or swimming, but it makes up for it with its lively surf culture.

There’s a pedestrian path above the beach along the Malecón, offering beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean, and it’s a great place to watch the surfers. Sunset views are spectacular. Parking can be tricky during busy times, and the beach doesn’t have many facilities beyond surf-related services, so plan accordingly.

2 stars for the wave, not the beach or park. I hate this wave. It is a boucning, small backwash runner. People take it as a left for small distances but it always closes out. There is very little paddling to get to this spot which is why I think people surf here. It jacks up very quickly, then gets hit by the backwash coming off the beach and flattens out to nothing; the wave washes right out from under your feet.

Like most of Lima’s beaches, it’s rocky rather than sandy, so it’s not ideal for lounging or swimming.

506,125,Purba Dutta,4,"Playa Makaha is one of the most iconic surfing beaches in Lima and a must-visit for anyone wanting to catch waves along the Costa Verde. Known for its consistent surf, it attracts both beginners and seasoned surfers. Several surf schools and board rental shops operate right at the beach, making it one of the easiest spots to learn or practice.

The beach is rocky, like most in Lima, so it’s not ideal for sunbathing, but the lively surf culture more than makes up for it. The view of the cliffs and the Malecón above adds to the atmosphere, and it’s also a great place to simply watch surfers in action if you’re not hitting the water yourself.

Overall, Playa Makaha is best for surfing and soaking up Lima’s coastal energy—one of the top choices for water sports in Miraflores.",2 weeks ago

The soft, warm sand is perfect for walking barefoot while enjoying the sun and the sea breeze. The crystal-clear water has a turquoise hue that looks like something out of a postcard, ideal for swimming or simply relaxing on the shore while listening to the sound of the waves.

In addition, the gastronomic offering near the beach is a true delight. Local restaurants offer a variety of fresh seafood prepared with traditional recipes, ranging from exquisite ceviches to parihuelas that revive the soul. All accompanied by warm service that makes you feel right at home.

San Pedro is not only perfect for sea lovers, but also for those looking for a serene place to share with family or friends. The sunset views are simply magical and offer an unforgettable moment you'll want to capture in a photo.

732,172,kiara J,1,"I'll start with the quality, which has dropped significantly this year. The pools are obviously poorly maintained. The slides are dirty and dusty on the outside, and the lack of paint in areas where the wear and tear on the bottom of the pool is noticeable, making it feel greasy. The floor/ground has some areas where something sticks out (it seems to be part of the material that ends in points), so if you brush your foot or knees against it, you can easily come out with scrapes and open wounds.

You can find dirty things in the pool, which is very unpleasant. We found a strip of underwear floating, and it stayed there for a while.

So, the last time I went, about two weeks ago, everyone in my family broke out in hives and itchy skin. We stopped eating because everyone ate something different. Maybe that's why there was a live report at the beginning of the year that I wasn't fit for use. I don't know what happened, but everything was fine. But oh well.

On the other hand, in other years the staff was more aware of everything, both the lifeguards and others.

The only clean thing I found was the restrooms at the beginning, and that's because by the end it was dirty due to the demand of people.

I hope they can improve by 2026.",7 months ago

They're very strict about bringing things into the venue, obviously aiming to buy everything inside. Admission is 40 soles for children and adults.

The Sacrament of Reconciliation is necessary.
Please fix the speakers a bit, as the homily is often hard to understand, and since the church is large, there's a lot of echo and reverberation.

Update 2019:
An iconic spot in the Lince district. Located across from Pedro Ruiz Gallo Park, attendees can park their cars because there are well-marked parking spaces.

To make matters worse, the teenage girls attending the entrance were rude; they giggled upon delivering news that since I was not a member with identification, I could not visit for one session. Laughing at not being inclusive is a sign of mockery and helps maintain the image that religion is ""bad"" through segregation. I hope the Church reads this review in order to help raise the next generation. This is not an acceptable behavior. PS.

1036,239,A V (globetrotter),5,"It’s designated as a World Monument in 2016 😎😎😎 despite its current state of disrepair, brought about by a devastating earthquake in 1940.

The WM designation  is a tribute to its historical and local folklore significance to the origin of Lima’s Barranco Borough as a fishing village.

Originally built in the 1870s, the neo-Gothic building of the Hermitage apparently underwent several reconstructions from destructions due to the War of the Pacific in the 1880s followed by natural disasters culminating in the 1940 earthquake. It has closed to the public since 1960. Emergency repairs have been going on since then.

As it stands since its WM designation, the roof is in very bad shape. IRONICALLY, the roof especially the “barebones” of the belfry looks so eerily pleasing 😎😎😎 as though it’s the ruins of a medieval castle. It looks the home or favorite sunning spot of a flock of huge vultures (gallinazos).

There must be changes for the better, starting from the reception and putting young and active people in to provide effective solutions to the community, sprucing up the places perhaps giving a change of paint, for this you can call the population and we will not be oblivious to your request.
What is needed is changes in everything and the father who has joined, I see that if he is interested in doing so, I hope that the young people arrive and do not leave disappointed believing that the parish is only for the elderly. I say this because they are the ones who manage all the parish groups and we need intelligent changes.",a year ago

1240,289,Eduardo Melendez Ruiz,5,"This place wasn't on my itinerary, but I am so glad that I went. The place does a great job of explaining the years of terrorism and violence in Peru. I had read a lot about those difficult years before and how Peru struggled with extreme violence and instability.

These exhibitions may be too graphic for some people, but I don't think it's good to hide the truth, especially when there are so many different narratives about these events. There's a section where they display the testimony of either actual victims of terrorism or close relatives of people who died during these years. I was holding back my tears.

Some people say the exhibition is biased in favor of the Peruvian government, but I didn't think that way because there are several mentions of how the Peruvian government also participated in the violence.

It is sad that the most affected were the working class and rural people. This was a tragedy.

The museum is located in a very good area, but I recommend to use a car or Uber/Cabify to get there. Entrance is free of charge and you just have to complete a simple form with your info.

The only thing I would change is that we need English translations because I think the world needs to know about this and stop pretending terrorists are social leaders.

1243,289,George “Geological” Lin,5,"The museum explains the violence that occurred between the Shining Path libration army (Maoist socialist group that gain power in the countryside) and the military. There were many victims and you get to hear their stories. Unfortunately the English explanation was non existent. The QR codes were suppose to take you to a Google drive page with English audio but I didn’t find it there on occasion. Also, the building is built on the cliffs and being surrounded by the cliffs did not make it easy to receive any signal… what I did realized was that there were a lot about the Shining paths atrocities but there wasn’t much regarding what the military did to the citizens caught in between. I’m just a casual visitor but I could tell it just from following up on wiki that there’s more to the story.

Exhibition aside, it’s an excellent contemporary architecture that is built into the cliff side. The entrance of the building makes you descend into the depths between the building and the cliffs methodically creating the feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place which is what many of the victims felt. The entire museum is connected via ramps (close to being wheelchair accessible) and light penetrations from both sides (from the windows) as well as from top to bottom (from the circular sky lites and glass gaps between the slab).

1280,297,Purba Dutta,4,"The Larco Museum in Lima is one of Peru’s finest museums and a must-visit for anyone interested in history and culture. Housed in an 18th-century colonial mansion, it features an outstanding collection of pre-Columbian art, including ceramics, textiles, metalwork, and jewelry from ancient civilizations like the Moche, Nazca, and Inca.

One of its highlights is the world-famous gallery of erotic pottery, which is both fascinating and unique. The museum also offers beautifully curated exhibits with clear explanations in multiple languages, making it easy to understand Peru’s rich cultural heritage. The gardens and café add to the experience, creating a relaxing atmosphere after exploring the galleries.

Perfect for culture lovers, history buffs, and anyone wanting a deeper understanding of Peru before (or after) visiting its archaeological sites.",4 weeks ago
1281,297,Catarina,5,"This museum isn't very big but it has amazing pieces. I would really recommend a guided tour which is offered at an extra 10 soles - it really does a much better job of explaining what we are looking at. Very interesting pieces divided in 3 areas: the main museum (perhaps 5-6 rooms), the erotic gallery, and visible storage. The surroundings are also very nice and there is a great fancy restaurant too. A big tip would be to come early: we got there at 10-ish and had a tour just for both of us; by the time we were going out there were lines for tickets and the museum was very crowded.",2 months ago
1282,297,Marilyn Flores,5,"Lovely place amazing collection of Indigenous artifacts, beautiful displays, and the garden, just stunning small but packed full of wonderful art.

1283,297,Johan Björefeldt,4,"Beautiful museum of artifacts from ancient Peruvian civilizations, including ceramics, textiles, and metalwork. The exhibits are nicely curated, and the collection is huge, but for an entry fee of 50 soles I would've expected a bit more variety and some other content than just constant display cases with accompanying text. Very interesting, but after a while it gets a little boring.

Beside the main museum there's a separate exhibit for ""erotic"" artifacts, mainly pottery portraying sexually explicit scenes. It's included in the main ticket price. There's also a souvenir shop and a restaurant on site.

There are explanatory texts in several languages for all exhibits, so English speakers for example can easily follow along. There's also an audio guide available, but this we didn't try. We spent approximately two hours walking through the museum, stopping briefly at most exhibits.",2 months ago
1284,297,Rodney Newton,5,"🌟 An unforgettable experience—leave yourself plenty of time!

Visited on Tuesday, July 1, 2025 with reservations from 5–7pm. We arrived early but were overdue for dinner, so we hit the restaurant before exploring the museum. Though that left us only about an hour inside. Despite the short visit, every detail of the museum, restaurant, and grounds impressed me.

🍽️ The restaurant is beautifully designed—definitely a bit upscale for my “hole-in-the-wall” tastes, but still worth the stop. Prices are on the higher side.
🌺 The grounds are stunning, with vibrant flowers everywhere and photo-worthy views around every corner.
🏺 The museum exhibits are top-notch, A+. What can be said about this collection that hasn't already been said? The quality, detail, and condition of these artifacts that are hundreds and thousands of years old, are second to none. Simply extraordinary. I'd recommend 3-5 hours or more if you really want to absorb and appreciate everything. So I'll definitely be returning for another visit as 1–2 hours isn’t nearly enough.

🗣️ Guided tours in Spanish are available for 10 soles and last about an hour. They didn’t offer English tours during our visit, but I believe they do offer them. They provide self-guided audio devices in English for the same price—I'll try that next time because I'm a fan of moving at my own pace.

🎁 Gift shop: Prices are steep, but it's a welcome addition. Far too many sites in Peru lack gift shops and miss the opportunity to cash in on visitors after the experience. People want souvenirs and they're willing to pay for them!

📍 Overall: This is a must-see destination for anyone visiting Lima. Don’t rush it—plan time to explore, then unwind with a meal or drink afterward.",3 months ago

1288,298,Saul Palomino,5,"My wife and I were happy that we decided to visit this museum this week. A few sections are not accessible, but due to the recent APEC summit, they have decided to go all in and they are currently exhibiting a few pieces they never exhibited before. There are pieces not even Peruvians have seen yet so, quality over quantity is the key. Last chance to see them too, as the museum will fully close for renovations at the end of February, and will not reopen until 2027-28.
A real Tumi, several gold and silver pieces and the best preserved textiles we've had the chance to see, are only a few of the elements that make this a worthy visit. Additionally, this museum has the real Estele Raimondi, one of the most important peruvian monoliths that still exists.
To finish, you will also get to see a well preserved colonial mansion, with original floors and a beautiful garden.

Last notes:
1. There are two entrances to the museum. Start your visit through the second one, that leads to the ""Casona"". This is the one that has most of the things that can be seen at the moment. Once you finish there, you can go to the main one (way less things to see atm), but mandatory if you want to see the Estele Raimondi.
2. Most of the texts are not translated in English, but it is what you could expect when visiting a non-English speaking country. It is part of the experience when visiting a foreign country.
3. There are a few breweries near the museum you can visit after, especially the traditional Queirolo Tabern, which has traditional food and drinks.",9 months ago

HOWEVER, collection/exhibition is very limited and has so narrow breath.

🫤 There’s complete lack of sculptures and/or 3D pieces.

* There MUST be a number of contemporary sculptors in Lima or nationwide, whose art are worth chasing after for exhibition here.

🫤 A lot of photographic exhibits are more of random shots of political events, lacking an artistic rendition of such events.

* The photos are VERY FLAT IMAGES rather than expressive imagery that would convey why the photographer was attracted by that instant in time.

* Many of the shots seem very elementary/rudimentary, lacking depths of focus.

*The photos FAIL TO EVOKE EMOTION, as such they seem misplaced for this museum.

🫤 Similarly, exhibitions of framed newspaper articles from the recent past are mere collages, like a hobbyist’s scrapbook. They FAIL TO CONVEY AN AESTHETIC rationale why they were put together.

1365,314,Elias Chelala (Chewy),5,"Monumento al Soldado Desconocido is a poignant and thought-provoking memorial that pays homage to the unknown soldiers who sacrificed their lives for a greater cause. Situated in a serene and well-maintained park, the monument exudes a sense of solemnity and respect.

The design of the monument is both striking and evocative, capturing the essence of the anonymous heroes it commemorates. The intricate details and symbolism incorporated into the sculpture provoke deep reflection on the profound impact of war and the sacrifices made by countless individuals who remain nameless.

The surrounding landscape adds to the overall ambiance, providing a peaceful setting for contemplation. The well-kept gardens and pathways create a tranquil environment, allowing visitors to pay their respects in a setting that encourages quiet introspection.

What sets this monument apart is its ability to convey a universal message about the collective sacrifice of soldiers, transcending national boundaries. It serves as a reminder that, regardless of nationality or background, the human cost of conflict is shared by all.

Visitors will appreciate the informative plaques and displays that offer historical context, enriching the experience with a deeper understanding of the monument's significance. The accessibility of the site, along with clear signage, makes it easy for both locals and tourists to find and appreciate this meaningful tribute.

Monumento al Soldado Desconocido is more than just a physical structure; it's a testament to the enduring spirit of those who gave their all without recognition. Whether you come to reflect on the history it represents or simply to enjoy the peaceful surroundings, this monument is a must-visit for anyone seeking a meaningful and contemplative experience.",a year ago

The current site has a museum and the excavations from the  structures built centuries ago - Sun Temple, Pachacamac, Acllawasi. During Inca rule (the last kingdom before Spanish Colonialisation), many people user to visit this site as a pilgrimage and many pyramids were built here. Sun Temple is supposed to have quite an ideal location based on planets and it faces the sea. There was a school built for girls called Acllawasi where they were taught day to day routine work.

In 2014, the Ministry of Culture launched a competition for architectural ideas for the MUNA, and based on this initiative, construction of the building began in 2016. As part of this long journey, on December 29, 2020, through Supreme Decree No. 018-2020-MC, the President of the Republic, Francisco Sagasti Hochhausler, formalized the creation of the National Museum of Peru, fulfilling a long-held republican aspiration.

The MUNA's mission is to be a space for dialogue and encounter through the protection and appreciation of cultural diversity, emphasizing the relationships and connections between different cultural groups of Peruvians in their territory throughout history.

The museum's vision is to become a governing and coordinating entity for the country's museums, capable of responding to the demands of preserving, researching, and disseminating the nation's cultural heritage.

Welcome to MUNA!",2 years ago

1393,319,A V (globetrotter),5,"A global traveler’s immersion into Peru’s Golden Treasures. It’s a great museum, thanks to foresight and generosity of Sñr Miguel Mujica Gallo whose personal collection has become a national treasure 🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪that now educates the world of ancient Peruvian cultures.

The collection is very well curated, with annotations of the periods and tribal identities 👏👏👏.

The golden artifacts illustrates why there was so much greed of the Imperial Conquistadors that drove them to enslave indigenous peoples of the Old World.

So varied golden treasures😎😎😎😎😎, from personal adornments to practical home utensils like cups and goblets to deities to tribal symbols including crowns and headgears.

In addition to the gold, the museum also carries pottery. Like the gold, each of the pottery is a tribal pride and of daily importance to peoples’ lives.

The other half of the museum is a curation of military arms/armaments and uniforms. Perhaps the most interesting are the medieval armory and the collection of daggers and swords.

Some of armory are pieces art themselves, the most eye catching are the collection of Japanese Samurai.

THIS NATIONAL TREASURE NEEDS MORE PUBLICITY. We only saw this by chance looking for things to do in Lima on Google.",7 months ago

1589,386,Anna C,5,"One of the best gift shops I’ve ever been to: a great place to pick up unique upmarket goods by Peruvian designers and craftspeople. A must for discerning shoppers!

I absolutely loved my visit here and ended up getting some unique jewelry. You can easily spend multiple hours looking at all the rooms, so plan accordingly if you love to shop/browse.

The shop includes homewares, clothing, a jewelry room, stationary, toys and kids items, a small selection of foods, and even a courtyard cafe with bonsai trees for sale.

Service is second to none. Associates will take your selections to the cashier while you continue to shop. Beautiful gift wrap is included with all purchases on request.

Some reviews have mentioned that perhaps some of the craft items are cheaper elsewhere. That may be the case, but there are a lot of brands I didn’t see elsewhere and everything is of the highest quality and carefully curated.

Don’t miss this store to check off your gift list for the year!",a month ago

1597,387,Juli Virgili,1,"We are an Argentine-Danish couple. We first met this horrible person when she came screaming at us—not talking, but yelling—telling us to leave the parking lot in front of her gallery, a PUBLIC place, without any signs prohibiting it, with the security guards patrolling all day without saying anything to us. For three months now, we have actively chosen to get to know and explore all of Peru, its landscapes, culture, and its people. We stay within the law, traveling, leaving dollars in the country at every place we visit, paying entrance fees to archaeological sites quoted in dollars, making purchases over 300 soles a week in supermarkets, buying tickets for buses, taxis, restaurants, cafes, excursions, laundromats, local crafts, museums… And yet, we had to endure this horrible being screaming in our faces that she doesn't want this kind of tourism, that we should leave, and she didn't stop kicking us out the whole time. Ma'am, if you have a problem, you talk things over, don't shout, especially not at those who consume culture and could have been your audience. We were there for three days; at no point did we camp out, take out furniture, or anything! We felt completely discriminated against, and there's no way back from that... And I remind you that in Argentina I also pay taxes, which go to the hospitals that our Peruvian brothers and sisters use 'for free,' BROKEN FACE! I recommend spending your time talking to your neighbor who has two campervans parked 24 hours a day in front of your gallery, instead of kicking out those who leave money in their country. I recommend people visit the Jade Rivera gallery and museum, an artist with beautiful works and a humble and heartfelt person whom we had the chance to meet. The murals around Barranco are also by Jade.",11 months ago

When I came back to the store after going to Dedalo, I walked around and looked at all the items on sale.

1701,412,Jesus Angulo,5,"2022 marks the year of the park's takeoff, as it looks completely renovated. In addition to the original attractions—the little train, the motorboat, the Jungle area, the Coast, and the aquarium—a series of inflatable games have been added, the most notable being the Island in the Lagoon, the New Jungle, a new inflatable that allows for family fun.
What has improved significantly are the restaurants and the food offerings on the go. There is a wide variety of cuisine, ranging from traditional grilled chicken, regional dishes, and fast food stands and restaurants in the country-style Felinario area.
The renovated 5D cinema is operational, but it is actually a 3D cinema with some additional effects, water, and compressed air.",3 years ago

The boat ride is paid separately, 10 soles for a wristband. It goes through a tunnel with a miniature Machu Picchu.

It’s clear that the team here is passionate about marine life and does their best to create a great experience for visitors, even while working with limited resources. Every employee I interacted with was knowledgeable, friendly, and eager to share insights about the animals and conservation efforts, which really made the visit special.

One of the most exciting aspects of my visit was hearing about the upcoming exhibits! The plans for expansion and new habitats sound incredible, and I can’t wait to see how they enhance the experience in the future. It’s clear that the aquarium is moving in a really positive direction, and I love that they’re always looking to improve.

That said, some of the older exhibits and systems could use a little TLC. A few tanks showed signs of wear, and certain areas felt like they could benefit from updates. However, given the effort and enthusiasm of the staff, I have no doubt that they’re doing everything they can to maintain and improve the facility.

Overall, Nautilus Aquarium is a great place to visit, especially for anyone who loves marine life and wants to support an organization that truly cares about its animals and its mission. I’m excited to see how it evolves, and I’ll definitely be back to check out the new exhibits when they open!",7 months ago

I ordered a very spicy mixed ceviche (S/40), however, when I tried it, it wasn't spicy at all. I didn't complain because I didn't want to ruin my lunch, and they had to add rocoto cream so it would be moderately spicy. That was my solution. The space inside the restaurant is average. They play music at a moderate volume, which allows for conversation if you go with others. You can park your vehicle outside, but on a busy day, I doubt you'll find a space. Finally, I can say that their chicha morada is a 10/10, and I give the ceviche I tried a 6.5/10.",a month ago
1944,474,Dulce Isidro,1,"I don't know if it was due to lack of staff or what, but they delayed taking the order, so far it's normal, it's something that can happen, right? But at the time of bringing the plates, the dishes were not clean, it seemed as if they had been served on top of a dirty plate. The young lady was asked but she only managed to say ""it's the juice from the ceviche."" When I tried the ceviche, the fish had a bad flavor, it tasted like ""fish"", it had dark parts that are normally removed when making ceviche since it gives a different flavor, the cassava was hard, the onion was already purple, due to being cooked too long. The worst of all? The thing is that the dish was returned but they brought another one with other ingredients (I think it was octopus) while the order was always a ""fish"" ceviche. I paid for the dish yes, but when I approached to complain at the end they kept making excuses, to clarify the dish it cost 35 so, if it were a dish of 10 it would pass and that, because in a crouch you could find it for 8 soles. When you go to a restaurant you expect something good and it is no excuse to say that then you go to a good area, because the prices they give do not reflect the ""quality"" for which you pay.",5 months ago

The chicha morada (1 liter for S/. 12) was delicious and with all that for three people it was very abundant.

And be very careful if it's raining or if you're wearing smooth shoes, as the bridge's deck is made of polished cement.

Housed in an 18th-century colonial mansion, it features an outstanding collection of pre-Columbian art, including ceramics, textiles, metalwork, and jewelry from ancient civilizations like the Moche, Nazca, and Inca.

One of its highlights is the world-famous gallery of erotic pottery, which is both fascinating and unique. The museum also offers beautifully curated exhibits with clear explanations in multiple languages, making it easy to understand Peru’s rich cultural heritage. The gardens and café add to the experience, creating a relaxing atmosphere after exploring the galleries.

Perfect for culture lovers, history buffs, and anyone wanting a deeper understanding of Peru before (or after) visiting its archaeological sites.",4 weeks ago
1999,486,Catarina,5,"This museum isn't very big but it has amazing pieces. I would really recommend a guided tour which is offered at an extra 10 soles - it really does a much better job of explaining what we are looking at. Very interesting pieces divided in 3 areas: the main museum (perhaps 5-6 rooms), the erotic gallery, and visible storage. The surroundings are also very nice and there is a great fancy restaurant too. A big tip would be to come early: we got there at 10-ish and had a tour just for both of us; by the time we were going out there were lines for tickets and the museum was very crowded.",2 months ago

2001,486,Johan Björefeldt,4,"Beautiful museum of artifacts from ancient Peruvian civilizations, including ceramics, textiles, and metalwork. The exhibits are nicely curated, and the collection is huge, but for an entry fee of 50 soles I would've expected a bit more variety and some other content than just constant display cases with accompanying text. Very interesting, but after a while it gets a little boring.

Beside the main museum there's a separate exhibit for ""erotic"" artifacts, mainly pottery portraying sexually explicit scenes. It's included in the main ticket price. There's also a souvenir shop and a restaurant on site.

There are explanatory texts in several languages for all exhibits, so English speakers for example can easily follow along. There's also an audio guide available, but this we didn't try. We spent approximately two hours walking through the museum, stopping briefly at most exhibits.",2 months ago
2002,486,Rodney Newton,5,"🌟 An unforgettable experience—leave yourself plenty of time!

Visited on Tuesday, July 1, 2025 with reservations from 5–7pm. We arrived early but were overdue for dinner, so we hit the restaurant before exploring the museum. Though that left us only about an hour inside. Despite the short visit, every detail of the museum, restaurant, and grounds impressed me.

🍽️ The restaurant is beautifully designed—definitely a bit upscale for my “hole-in-the-wall” tastes, but still worth the stop. Prices are on the higher side.
🌺 The grounds are stunning, with vibrant flowers everywhere and photo-worthy views around every corner.
🏺 The museum exhibits are top-notch, A+. What can be said about this collection that hasn't already been said? The quality, detail, and condition of these artifacts that are hundreds and thousands of years old, are second to none. Simply extraordinary. I'd recommend 3-5 hours or more if you really want to absorb and appreciate everything. So I'll definitely be returning for another visit as 1–2 hours isn’t nearly enough.

🗣️ Guided tours in Spanish are available for 10 soles and last about an hour. They didn’t offer English tours during our visit, but I believe they do offer them. They provide self-guided audio devices in English for the same price—I'll try that next time because I'm a fan of moving at my own pace.

🎁 Gift shop: Prices are steep, but it's a welcome addition. Far too many sites in Peru lack gift shops and miss the opportunity to cash in on visitors after the experience. People want souvenirs and they're willing to pay for them!

📍 Overall: This is a must-see destination for anyone visiting Lima. Don’t rush it—plan time to explore, then unwind with a meal or drink afterward.",3 months ago

2037,494,Scarlet Salas,3,"I really expected much more from this place. The hike isn't much, as it's quick and there isn't much to see along the way. The most worthwhile option is the catamaran ride, which costs extra and is where you can actually see a few more birds, although I don't know if it was when I went in late May when there were few more because it was autumn. The most abundant are the red-crested pochards and vultures, which were abundant. Admission is by group, and in my case, it took a while because there were only two guides.
The wetland, because they indicated it's not a swamp, is organized and clean. But for the entrance fee plus the extras you have to pay, it seems expensive to me, as what you'll see isn't dazzling. You'll see more birds in the adjacent areas and in that neighborhood, which is on the side, called Brisas de Villa.

2060,501,Elias Chelala (Chewy),5,"Monumento al Soldado Desconocido is a poignant and thought-provoking memorial that pays homage to the unknown soldiers who sacrificed their lives for a greater cause. Situated in a serene and well-maintained park, the monument exudes a sense of solemnity and respect.

The design of the monument is both striking and evocative, capturing the essence of the anonymous heroes it commemorates. The intricate details and symbolism incorporated into the sculpture provoke deep reflection on the profound impact of war and the sacrifices made by countless individuals who remain nameless.

The surrounding landscape adds to the overall ambiance, providing a peaceful setting for contemplation. The well-kept gardens and pathways create a tranquil environment, allowing visitors to pay their respects in a setting that encourages quiet introspection.

What sets this monument apart is its ability to convey a universal message about the collective sacrifice of soldiers, transcending national boundaries. It serves as a reminder that, regardless of nationality or background, the human cost of conflict is shared by all.

Visitors will appreciate the informative plaques and displays that offer historical context, enriching the experience with a deeper understanding of the monument's significance. The accessibility of the site, along with clear signage, makes it easy for both locals and tourists to find and appreciate this meaningful tribute.

Monumento al Soldado Desconocido is more than just a physical structure; it's a testament to the enduring spirit of those who gave their all without recognition. Whether you come to reflect on the history it represents or simply to enjoy the peaceful surroundings, this monument is a must-visit for anyone seeking a meaningful and contemplative experience.",a year ago

During Inca rule (the last kingdom before Spanish Colonialisation), many people user to visit this site as a pilgrimage and many pyramids were built here. Sun Temple is supposed to have quite an ideal location based on planets and it faces the sea. There was a school built for girls called Acllawasi where they were taught day to day routine work. The excavation work is still in progress here. Entry ticket is 15 Soles for regular route and 20 Soles for special route. It was great knowing about this much ancient history.

O Santuário possuía outras muralhas internas que protegiam os prédios e dividiam os tipos de atividades no local e além de facilitar a defesa do local de eventuais invasões, também permitia controlar o acesso de peregrinos e viajantes aos templos e locais sagrados, através de postos de controle existentes nos portões ao longo da Calle Norte-Sur.
Evidências encontradas no local indicam que a cidadela, fundada por volta de um mil a um mil e quinhentos anos atrás, reunia grandes centros cerimoniais, prédios administrativos e militares e concentrava grande número de habitantes.

While preparing for the national celebration of José Chavez, the plane he piloted had mechanical problems that he ordered his co-pilot to parachute to safety. He flew the troubled plane out of the populated area of Lima, crashing into then an open field on the cliffs of Miraflores Borough, saving hundreds of lives at the expense of his own!

The park was built by Lima City in 1953 to honor Salazar Southwell’s ultimate sacrifice.

The cliffside location gives you a panoramic view of the coastline, surfers in the water, and the famous Costa Verde highway running below. It’s a peaceful place to walk, relax, or just sit and take in the ocean breeze. The area is well-maintained, with walking paths, benches, and nearby cafés to grab a coffee while enjoying the scenery.

The so-called garden is even worst. There’s a very shallow pond, more like a hand washing pool, that is so overcrowded with Koi👎. The poor creatures must be boiling in it under the heat of the equatorial sun. Over this pond a “bridge”, more like 3- foot plank, that is made of hollow plastic resin.

Walking among the ruins—especially the Temple of the Sun and the Painted Temple—you really feel the spiritual and historical weight of the site.

The on-site museum is excellent: modern, informative, and well-curated, with artefacts that add depth and context to what you see outside. Exhibits are displayed beautifully, and the signage (in both Spanish and English) helps paint a vivid picture of the cultures that once thrived here.

During Inca rule (the last kingdom before Spanish Colonialisation), many people user to visit this site as a pilgrimage and many pyramids were built here. Sun Temple is supposed to have quite an ideal location based on planets and it faces the sea. There was a school built for girls called Acllawasi where they were taught day to day routine work.

This huaca belonged to the Ichma culture and its structures were made with river stones and mud bricks forming a pyramid with ramps and staircases.

Prior to its restoration, the place was looted by ""huaqueros"", unscrupulous people who violate these places for profit, although, in spite of this, it was possible to find remains of vessels, textiles, bones, instruments, mollusk shells, spondylus and also a funerary bundle in excellent condition.

Despite announcements and promises to offer the huaca for the visit of those interested in history, culture, architecture and other branches of science, they have not even built the promised small Site Museum nor constructed the 11 cabinets for research and other purposes.

It's a small circular plaza with concentric circles forming labyrinthine paths separated by stones on which the names of some of the victims are written. I don't know the history of this place very well; I know that it could be, like almost any topic related to the era of terrorism, sanctified, used to separate us as Peruvians, and therefore a source of controversy.
The biggest problem with this space is that it's closed; it's not a place that welcomes people who pass by. As a place that commemorates and remembers difficult times in our country, it would be important to transform it into a space for sharing, where we can truly connect. Next to this monument, they've placed a children's playground and a bar area with loud music (not as loud as the concerts that are organized from time to time at the Lawn Tennis Club across the street). A perimeter fence separates the Weeping Eye from the rest of the park, which has gated access and scheduled times.

It fell under the influence of the Cusco expansion that would constitute the future Tahuantinsuyu.

Currently, this archaeological site is neglected and is a dangerous area to visit without prior preventive measures. We must first ensure that no one is in the ruined rooms in the administrative zone (in the flat area, halfway up the hill).

Walking among the ruins—especially the Temple of the Sun and the Painted Temple—you really feel the spiritual and historical weight of the site.

The on-site museum is excellent: modern, informative, and well-curated, with artefacts that add depth and context to what you see outside. Exhibits are displayed beautifully, and the signage (in both Spanish and English) helps paint a vivid picture of the cultures that once thrived here.

The current site has a museum and the excavations from the  structures built centuries ago - Sun Temple, Pachacamac, Acllawasi. During Inca rule (the last kingdom before Spanish Colonialisation), many people user to visit this site as a pilgrimage and many pyramids were built here. Sun Temple is supposed to have quite an ideal location based on planets and it faces the sea. There was a school built for girls called Acllawasi where they were taught day to day routine work. The excavation work is still in progress here. Entry ticket is 15 Soles for regular route and 20 Soles for special route. It was great knowing about this much ancient history.

3067,772,Tim Hodgden,2,The museum is definitely still being remodeled and lots of areas are not available. It was free for English speakers because very little signage in English.

Go if you are good with just walking around and looking at exhibits or feel like translating lots on your phone.,a month ago
3068,772,Saul Palomino,5,"My wife and I were happy that we decided to visit this museum this week. A few sections are not accessible, but due to the recent APEC summit, they have decided to go all in and they are currently exhibiting a few pieces they never exhibited before. There are pieces not even Peruvians have seen yet so, quality over quantity is the key. Last chance to see them too, as the museum will fully close for renovations at the end of February, and will not reopen until 2027-28.
A real Tumi, several gold and silver pieces and the best preserved textiles we've had the chance to see, are only a few of the elements that make this a worthy visit. Additionally, this museum has the real Estele Raimondi, one of the most important peruvian monoliths that still exists.
To finish, you will also get to see a well preserved colonial mansion, with original floors and a beautiful garden.

Last notes:
1. There are two entrances to the museum. Start your visit through the second one, that leads to the ""Casona"". This is the one that has most of the things that can be seen at the moment. Once you finish there, you can go to the main one (way less things to see atm), but mandatory if you want to see the Estele Raimondi.
2. Most of the texts are not translated in English, but it is what you could expect when visiting a non-English speaking country. It is part of the experience when visiting a foreign country.
3. There are a few breweries near the museum you can visit after, especially the traditional Queirolo Tabern, which has traditional food and drinks.",9 months ago

The showers have very little hot water, so bathing was frustrating.

There was no cable the first day, and the other days they cut it off at midnight.

There is a barbecue area, but like I said, they charge you for everything, and quite a lot.

There are time limits for arrival and/or departure at night, which is ridiculous; I'm a paying guest, not a prisoner.

The grills they can only do are after 6 p.m. If you want to cook your own lunch, you can't.
If someone visits you during the day, they charge you 50 soles per guest from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.
The ""pool"" is a shallow pool that was filled with three people.

They don't have the address on their Facebook page, but their Instagram page lists it as central (Defensores del Morro 550). I had to go to this location in person only to be told that the procedure I wanted to complete is done at the La Curva location (Huaylas/Defensores del Morro 2765). It's a waste of time and disrespectful to the residents and taxpayers of the district, many of them elderly who have trouble getting around. Even worse, I'm asking for a question that could have been EASILY resolved over the phone. It's the last straw that there's NO means of communication with the Municipality because the ones they have are just for show and they don't answer. Please answer your phones, use your social media accounts, and at least update your address!",7 months ago
3556,901,tito martinez,5,"Gentlemen, between Julio Calero and Haiti Streets, there is a house that has been abandoned for many years. The bush has grown so large that it only serves as a hiding place and is increasingly used for stealing.
In other years, requests have been made to cut it down, and they have done so.
Please consider this request.",6 years ago
3557,901,Dr Jorge Reyna,1,"Attention all citizens of Chorrillos and beyond! Zero stars for the Municipality and its shameful team. My mother dedicated 35 years of her life serving the community, earning everyone's respect for her tireless work helping hundreds of people. And what did she receive in return? Total contempt.

Unfortunately, the administration of Mr. Pablo Gutierrez Weselby and Mr. Agusto Miyashiro was marked by ignorance and flagrant violation of laws and collective bargaining agreements. Where have the raises and bonuses that pensioners are legally entitled to? They weren't given to them, and to top it all off, Mr. Gutierrez had the audacity to publicly display the list of pensioners with their names and salaries on the wall of the Huaylas office. What happened to human rights and privacy?

Recently, I had the misfortune of going to the Municipality to request my father's widow's pension after my mother's death. What an ordeal! The people at the counter seem to be in another world. Almost a month and no sign of progress. They don't allow access to human resources and give you an extension number that never answers. You leave messages and no one bothers to return the call.

It's shocking to see how Peru hasn't progressed since I left in 1999. Of course, institutions like the Municipality of Chorrillos are plagued by incompetence and lack of motivation. But remember, one day those same individuals will be elderly, and life will take its toll on them for the damage they have inflicted on others.

It's time to wake up and demand real change in our institutions. We cannot allow corruption, violence, and chaos to continue to dominate our beloved Peru. Let's demand a better future for all! 🇵🇪 #PeruWakeUp #ChorrillosInCrisis",2 years ago
3558,901,Silvia Murillo,1,"By far the worst of the municipalities, its staff is highly incompetent. Phone calls can keep you on hold for up to an hour, only to be hung up on without ever answering. They force you to expose yourself to procedures that should be virtual, demanding things that are above the Administrative Simplification Law. The worst service of all.",3 years ago

You only pay by card for less than S/. 50 soles. No preferential service. No waiting tables. Being here is like stepping back in time to the 1980s.",7 years ago

3567,904,CFORT S.A.,5,"ACULL is a non-profit institution that brings together children and residents of Llamapsillo, Chongos Alto, Huancayo, Peru, in the capital city of Lima. It promotes culture and sports, uniting families who proudly display their surnames and, with them, their customs and traditions, preserving their cultural identity.
The Acull anthem, a poetic composition that describes the institutional sentiment and emotion, is thanks to Isaac Moreno, and the musical arrangements, the solemn tone that resonates in the conscience and heart of each of its members, are thanks to Santiago Moreno, both brothers, honorary members of Acull.
The Acull coat of arms, a symbol that represents us, features the mythical animal that identifies our origins, the llama, as well as the book and the ball, which symbolize study and sports. Its golden hue symbolizes abundance, prosperity, and well-being, and the black color of professionalism and seriousness, an improved design by Yen Yarin.
An institution that brings together hardworking, determined, entrepreneurial, and progressive people who proudly practice their ancestral Inca traditions such as Ayni and Minka.",a year ago
